# User Stories for JavaScript Fundamentals Challenges

## Challenge 1: User Data Manager - User Stories

### Epic: User Management System
As a developer learning JavaScript fundamentals, I want to build a user management system that demonstrates modern JavaScript concepts and their application in React development.

---

### Story 1: Create User Profiles
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** add new users to the system  
**So that** I can manage user accounts and their preferences  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can create a user with name, email, and age
- [ ] The system assigns a unique ID to each user
- [ ] Default preferences (theme: "light", notifications: true) are applied if not provided
- [ ] User data is validated (name and email are required)
- [ ] The system prevents duplicate users with the same email
- [ ] I receive a user object with all fields populated after successful creation

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use `const` and `let` appropriately for variable declarations
- Implement object destructuring with default parameters
- Use spread operator for immutable data handling
- Apply input validation using conditional logic

---

### Story 2: Update User Information
**As a** user  
**I want to** update my profile information  
**So that** my account reflects current and accurate data  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can update any user field (name, email, age, preferences)
- [ ] Partial updates are supported (only changed fields need to be provided)
- [ ] Nested preference updates work correctly
- [ ] The system preserves existing data for fields not being updated
- [ ] I receive the updated user object after successful modification
- [ ] The system handles invalid user IDs gracefully

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use object destructuring for parameter handling
- Implement nested object merging with spread operator
- Use array `map` method for immutable updates
- Handle edge cases with conditional logic

---

### Story 3: Retrieve User Data
**As a** application developer  
**I want to** fetch user information by ID or get all users  
**So that** I can display user data in my interface  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can retrieve a specific user by their unique ID
- [ ] I can get a list of all users in the system
- [ ] The system returns null for non-existent user IDs
- [ ] I receive copies of user data to prevent accidental modifications
- [ ] The data structure is consistent and predictable

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use array `find` method for single user lookup
- Use spread operator to return data copies
- Implement proper error handling for edge cases

---

### Story 4: Filter Users by Preferences
**As a** UI developer  
**I want to** filter users based on their preferences  
**So that** I can create customized user experiences  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can filter users by theme preference (light/dark)
- [ ] I can filter users by notification preference (enabled/disabled)
- [ ] I can filter by any preference key-value combination
- [ ] The system returns an array of matching users
- [ ] Empty arrays are returned when no users match the criteria

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use array `filter` method for data filtering
- Implement object destructuring to access nested preferences
- Use proper comparison operators for different data types

---

### Story 5: Generate User Summaries for Display
**As a** frontend developer  
**I want to** get simplified user data for list displays  
**So that** I can render user lists efficiently in React components  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can get user summaries with only essential fields (id, name, email)
- [ ] The system provides computed display names
- [ ] Data is formatted consistently for UI consumption
- [ ] The transformation doesn't affect original user data

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use array `map` method for data transformation
- Implement object destructuring for field extraction
- Use template literals for string formatting

---

### Story 6: Calculate User Statistics
**As a** analytics developer  
**I want to** get user statistics and demographics  
**So that** I can display dashboard metrics  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can get total user count
- [ ] I can see user distribution by theme preference
- [ ] I can see user distribution by notification settings
- [ ] Statistics update automatically when user data changes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use array `reduce` method for data aggregation
- Implement object destructuring for preference access
- Use computed property names for dynamic object creation

---

## React Integration Stories

### Story 7: User Profile Component Integration
**As a** React developer  
**I want to** use UserManager data in React components  
**So that** I can build dynamic user interfaces  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User data integrates seamlessly with React props
- [ ] Component props use destructuring patterns
- [ ] Default values work correctly in component parameters
- [ ] Nested preference data is easily accessible
- [ ] Component updates reflect UserManager changes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Props destructuring with default parameters
- Nested destructuring for user preferences
- Callback functions for user interactions
- Proper event handling patterns

---

### Story 8: User List Component with Filtering
**As a** React developer  
**I want to** render filtered user lists  
**So that** I can create dynamic user directory interfaces  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User lists render using array `map` method
- [ ] Filtering controls update displayed users
- [ ] User selection triggers callback functions
- [ ] Component state integrates with UserManager methods
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large user lists

**Technical Requirements:**
- Array methods for data transformation and filtering
- Event handlers using arrow functions
- State management patterns compatible with React hooks
- Proper key handling for list rendering

---

### Story 9: User Management Dashboard
**As a** admin user  
**I want to** manage users through a React interface  
**So that** I can perform all user operations through a modern UI  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can add new users through a form interface
- [ ] I can edit existing users inline or in modal dialogs
- [ ] I can view user statistics in real-time
- [ ] I can filter and search users dynamically
- [ ] All operations provide immediate visual feedback

**Technical Requirements:**
- Form handling with controlled components
- State management for complex user interactions
- Event callback patterns for user operations
- Integration with UserManager event system
