# NextStep
NextStep is a virtual counselor app designed to guide graduating high school seniors through the often-overlooked challenges of transitioning into adulthood. The app provides practical tools, resources, and step-by-step guidance on essential topics that schools rarely cover such as job readiness, financial literacy, and personal development.
