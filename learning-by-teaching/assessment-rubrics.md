# Assessment Rubrics: Learning by Teaching

## üéØ Overview

These rubrics evaluate both **student teaching effectiveness** and **learning outcomes** in the Learning by Teaching methodology. Assessment focuses on the quality of instruction, depth of understanding, and practical application.

|-------|----------|-------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Breaks complex problems into logical, teachable steps; guides LLM through systematic problem-solving approach | 90-100% |
| **Proficient (3)** | Identifies main problem components, provides general guidance with some structure | 80-89% |
| **Developing (2)** | Basic problem breakdown, guidance lacks clear sequence or misses key components | 70-79% |
| **Beginning (1)** | Unable to break down problems effectively, provides disconnected or confusing guidance | Below 70% |

### 3. Teaching Interaction Quality

| Level | Criteria | Score |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Asks probing questions, responds to LLM confusion with clarification, adapts teaching based on LLM responses | 90-100% |
| **Proficient (3)** | Asks some follow-up questions, provides clarification when needed, shows some adaptability | 80-89% |
| **Developing (2)** | Limited interaction, basic responses to LLM questions, minimal adaptation of teaching approach | 70-79% |
| **Beginning (1)** | One-way communication, ignores LLM confusion, rigid teaching approach | Below 70% |

### 4. Code Review & Feedback Quality

| Level | Criteria | Score |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Provides detailed, constructive feedback; identifies strengths and weaknesses; suggests specific improvements with rationale | 90-100% |
| **Proficient (3)** | Gives helpful feedback, identifies most issues, provides general improvement suggestions | 80-89% |
| **Developing (2)** | Basic feedback, catches obvious errors, limited improvement suggestions | 70-79% |
| **Beginning (1)** | Minimal or unhelpful feedback, misses significant issues, no clear improvement path | Below 70% |

## üß† Learning Outcome Assessment Rubric

### 1. JavaScript Concept Mastery

| Level | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Deep understanding demonstrated through teaching; can explain "why" behind concepts; connects to React patterns naturally | Can explain closure concepts through practical examples, connects array methods to React rendering patterns |
| **Proficient (3)** | Solid understanding of concepts; can teach most topics accurately; makes some React connections | Understands destructuring well enough to teach it, sees some React applications |
| **Developing (2)** | Basic understanding; can teach simple concepts but struggles with complex ones; limited React connections | Can explain variables and basic objects, struggles with higher-order functions |
| **Beginning (1)** | Minimal understanding; teaching reveals significant gaps; no clear React connections | Confused about basic concepts, cannot explain them to others |

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach

| Level | Criteria | Indicators |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Systematic, logical approach; teaches debugging strategies; guides LLM to discover solutions | Breaks problems into testable pieces, teaches error identification methods |
| **Proficient (3)** | Generally logical approach; some debugging guidance; helps LLM work through problems | Can guide through step-by-step problem solving with some debugging |
| **Developing (2)** | Basic problem-solving; limited debugging help; provides direct answers instead of guidance | Tends to give solutions rather than teach problem-solving process |
| **Beginning (1)** | Chaotic approach; no debugging strategy; unable to guide problem-solving | Cannot break down problems or guide solution discovery |

### 3. Communication & Technical Writing

| Level | Criteria | Evidence |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Clear, precise technical communication; uses appropriate terminology; explanations are accessible yet accurate | Technical terms used correctly, complex concepts explained simply |
| **Proficient (3)** | Generally clear communication; mostly correct terminology; explanations are understandable | Good use of technical language with clear explanations |
| **Developing (2)** | Sometimes unclear; inconsistent terminology use; explanations may confuse rather than clarify | Technical terms sometimes misused, explanations lack clarity |
| **Beginning (1)** | Unclear communication; incorrect terminology; confusing or inaccurate explanations | Poor technical communication, confusing explanations |

### 4. Metacognitive Awareness

| Level | Criteria | Behaviors |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Exemplary (4)** | Reflects on teaching effectiveness; identifies own knowledge gaps; adapts teaching strategies based on results | "I realize I don't fully understand closures myself, let me research this before teaching it" |
| **Proficient (3)** | Some reflection on teaching; recognizes when explanations aren't working; makes basic adjustments | "Let me try explaining this differently since the LLM seems confused" |
| **Developing (2)** | Limited reflection; basic awareness of teaching success/failure; minimal strategy adjustment | "This isn't working but I'm not sure why" |
| **Beginning (1)** | No reflection on teaching effectiveness; unaware of learning gaps; no strategy adaptation | Continues with ineffective teaching without recognition |

## üéØ Self-Assessment Questions

### For Students to Reflect:
1. **Conceptual Understanding**: "Can I explain this concept without looking at notes?"
2. **Teaching Clarity**: "Did the LLM understand my explanation on the first try?"
3. **Problem-Solving**: "Did I guide discovery or just give answers?"
4. **Adaptation**: "How did I adjust when my teaching wasn't working?"
5. **Growth Mindset**: "What did I learn about my own understanding through teaching?"

### For Instructors to Observe:
1. **Engagement Level**: How actively does the student interact with the LLM?
2. **Error Recovery**: How does the student handle teaching mistakes?
3. **Depth vs Breadth**: Does the student prioritize understanding over completion?
4. **Patience Level**: Can the student persist through LLM confusion?
5. **Real-world Connection**: Does the student connect concepts to practical applications?
